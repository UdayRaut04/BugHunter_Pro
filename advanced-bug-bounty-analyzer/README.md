# BugHunter Pro – Advanced Bug Bounty Analyzer

## Overview

**BugHunter Pro** is an educational and practical application for analyzing and simulating advanced bug bounty vulnerability workflows. Ideal for cybersecurity learners, bug bounty enthusiasts, and security teams, it covers reconnaissance, vulnerability detection, simulated exploitation, and professional reporting.

- **Type:** Client-side app (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Purpose:** Hands-on learning and demonstration of bug bounty methodologies

## Features

- Reconnaissance (subdomain, port & tech stack simulation)
- Automated and manual vulnerability analysis (OWASP Top 10, business logic flaws)
- API and session testing modules
- Realistic scanning/report generation
- Safe simulated environment — does **NOT** scan or attack live sites by default

### Recommended for Developers

- Start a local server in the project folder for full functionality:
    - **Python:**
        ```
        cd C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\advanced-bug-bounty-analyzer
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

    - **VS Code Live Server:**
        - Open the folder in VS Code, right-click `index.html`, choose "Open with Live Server".

    - **Node.js (optional):**
        ```
        npm install -g http-server
        cd C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\advanced-bug-bounty-analyzer
        http-server
        ```

## Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- [Optional] Python 3.x (for running a local web server)
- [Optional] VS Code with Live Server extension

## Usage

- Browse the interface to simulate reconnaissance and vulnerability testing.
- Use the reporting feature to practice submitting bug bounty findings.
